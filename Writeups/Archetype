1.nmap -sV -sC
We find an SMB share as well as a SQL server. We will try to access the SMB share
2. smbclient -N -L \\\\TARGETIP\\
This will:
-N no password
-L list the shares available
3. smbclient -N \\\\TARGETIP\\backups
with this we can access the backups share
4. We find a file on the share called prodConfig or some shit like that, so we pull it into the local machine
5. Inside we find a password. We save it so we can try to use it and connect to the sql service. 
6. We connect using impacket and the mysqlclient.py script. We provided the password previously acquired

or executed commands. To do that, we will read the PowerShell history file, which is the equivalent of
