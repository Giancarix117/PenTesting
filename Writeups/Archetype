1.nmap -sV -sC
We find an SMB share as well as a SQL server. We will try to access the SMB share
2. smbclient -N -L \\\\TARGETIP\\
This will:
-N no password
-L list the shares available
3. smbclient -N \\\\TARGETIP\\backups
with this we can access the backups share
4. We find a file on the share called prodConfig or some shit like that, so we pull it into the local machine
5. Inside we find a password. We save it so we can try to use it and connect to the sql service.
